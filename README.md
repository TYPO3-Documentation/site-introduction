## ðŸš€ Quick Start Using Docker

You can run the screenshot project locally using the prebuilt Docker image:

```bash
docker run -d --name typo3-screenshots -p 8080:80 linawolf/typo3-screenshots
```

Follow the logs to track progress:

```bash
docker logs -f typo3-screenshots
```

Once setup is complete, open:

```
http://localhost:8080/typo3
```

**Login credentials:**

- **Username:** `j.doe`
- **Password:** `Password.1`

> [!NOTE]
> The container resets on every run. Itâ€™s ideal for reproducible test environments and fresh screenshots.

## ðŸ”§ Development
