# DDEV Setup

To use this repository we recommend to use ddev as environment. Please download
and install DDEV https://github.com/drud/ddev/releases.

[LINUX] Change permissions of ./var to 0777 (`chmod 0777 ./var/cache`) on host

* `ddev start`
* `ddev import-db --src=./data/db.sql`
* `ddev import-files --src=./assets`
* `ddev composer install`

# TYPO3 Version

The development of this installation started with TYPO3 v9.  
Branches and Tags include a version number that indicates the TYPO3 version.

# Frontend

* PHP My Admin: http://introduction.ddev.site:8036

# Credentials Backend

# Executing Commands

If you need to execute commands like `composer` or `bin/typo3` you need to run
these commands within the ddev containers. You can easily log into the web
container by executing the command `ddev ssh`. Its also possible to run commands
within the container without the need to log into it.

* Composer Install: `ddev composer install`
* Database Export: `ddev exec bin/typo3 ddev:exportdb`

# Execute acceptance tests

To execute acceptance tests the selenium service has to be enabled before starting DDEV.
This can be done by renaming the file `.ddev/docker-compose.chrome.yaml.inactive`
to `.ddev/docker-compose.chrome.yaml`.
Consideration for deactivating the service by default has been that other tests run
significantly faster when this service is deactivated.

The ddev setup comes with a selenium-chrome container, codeception and some
acceptance tests ready to run.

* Run tests: `ddev composer test`

# Environment Variables

This setup is preconfigured to work with ddev. If you plan to use this setup
